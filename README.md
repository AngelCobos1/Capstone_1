Point-Scoring Differences Among First Round NBA Draft Picks
‌
By:‌ ‌Angel‌ ‌Cobos‌ ‌

***CAUTION: Repository is currently being restructured and reevaluated.***

The original intention of this analysis and updates can be found below:

Ho= There is no statistical difference in the NBA point-scoring performances of the first fourteen draft picks and the last sixteen draft picks of the first round.

Ha = There is a statistical difference in the NBA point-scoring performances of the first fourteen draft picks and the last sixteen draft picks of the first round.

If my analysis rejects the null hypothesis, the conclusions could provide a valuable lens to examine draftees and expenses incurred to attain them.
Rookie salaries are determined by a draftees' draft order and are non-negotiable for the first two years. Any organization can leverage the discounting of mid-to-late First Round Draft Picks into contracting stronger, fuller rosters for reduced capital investment.

Initially, I analyzed the compiled data set provided by Justinas Cirtautas at 'https://www.kaggle.com/justinas/nba-players-data.' This particular data set consisted of player data for each season going as far back as 1996. Data concerning the draft year, seasonal performance statistics, and season of play are of particular interest. However, not all the data is as useful to my analysis. I examined the last ten years of NBA seasons and the metric of average points per game. This subset provided comprehensive observations from which to analyze. I isolated sample groups to a player's first three seasons of play. The assumption being that by the end of the third year, we should have seen some normalization of their seasonal performance.

The prelimanary goal was to assess whether there are any point-scoring differences between the first half of the first-round draft picks and the last half of first-round draft picks.

**UPDATE: 03/15/2021:

RE: drafts_script, stats_script-A requirements.txt file has been added for convenviance of replicating the requests to be done from the nba.stats.com url.

Currently re-workging the A/B testing for a more ADVANCED analysis.

**UPDATE: 02/19/2021:

Data Source-New data has been sourced directly from the nba.stats.com website. I uploaded the step-by-step walkthrough of the reproducible code for requesting the information under the NBA_Stats.ipynb and the NBA_SeasonStats.ipynb files. I still need to provide the virtual environment and provide .py files for the condensed code.
